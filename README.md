# Employee Participation: Front end

## ℹ️ About
This is a Next.js project that simulates a website where employers can register the participation rate of their employees in each of their projects. Data is represented through the use of common graphs (donut charts and bar charts). 

This website is responsive to all screes sizes.

Data was consumed from an API developed by me. The link of the github repository is: https://github.com/francinehahn/employee-participation-backend
